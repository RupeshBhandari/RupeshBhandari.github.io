Musk has repeatedly touted Autopilot — which automates some driving tasks but doesn't grant cars full autonomy — as a revolutionary safety feature that can slash the likelihood of getting in a crash by a factor of 10. But the data Tesla uses to back up that claim is incomplete at best.

Attacking value investing and claiming that the style of investing is "dead" has become quite popular over the past decade. Critics' voices became even louder last year when so-called growth stocks roared higher as the bull market continued despite the Covid-19 pandemic.

## Amazon is slated to overtake Walmart as the largest retailer in the US

2021-04-27 14:49:26 Business Insider

Walmart's not the only retail giant in town anymore. In fact, one market research study found that Amazon is on track to overtake its Arkansas-based competitor in terms of gross market value within the next few years.  A study from Edge by Ascential calculated that Amazon's gross market value will reach $631.6 billion by 2025, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14% between 2020 and 2025. That means that the digitally native powerhouse is set to eclipse Walmart as the largest retailer in the United States. Walmart's gross market value is slated to rise to $523.3 billion by 2025, a CAGR of 3.9%.
